			<h2>Always Be A Student</h2>
			<p>This is the philosophy I keep to. I started my path into Software development after completing my High school courses early. filling my time by attending a career school in which I studied Engineering, Law, and Computer Science. In this time I gained valuable experience in web development, moble app development, and game development. Since then I've continued in my pursuit of knowledge by reading countless textbooks, attending a coding bootcamp and completing several online classes/tutorials. Thoughout all this time the most valuable lesson I've learned is there is always something you can learn from someone or something. </p>
			<q>Every great developer you know got there by solving problems
				they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.
